# Projects slides

We invite our Ecosystem to add the slides of their own projects to share them with the whole IOTA Community.  
Please try to keep it between one, maximum three slides.

Add your presentation through a PR in github.
If possible use the OpenDocument format.  

Use the following filename ormat:
